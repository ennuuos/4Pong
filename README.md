## 4Pong
_Pong with a twist or two_

This game was made as a personal challenge to learn lua/love2d in about 1.5-2 hours. It's basically pong with 4 players and three game modes, normal, clone and disco, and also AI.

- Normal mode is just pong with 4 players, each time a wall is hit health goes down.
- Clone mode gets really hard because the ball doubles whenever it hits a wall
- Disco mode has an __epillepsy warning__, it flashes random colours and changes the music. Can be combined with the other two modes.

To play, open with love and choose amount of players and modes.

TODO: add compiled version.
